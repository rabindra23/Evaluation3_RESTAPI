I have done authentication in mycontroller class itself, for i have used loginreq class in which mobile number and password is taken for authentication purpose.

Validation is done in entity class itself for user class and fir class.

Status code is taken care in mycontroller class.

The required http method which were asked in the table is implemented in mycontroller class along with proper url.

USER-:

POST - /masaifir/user/register
POST - /masaifir/user/login
GET - /masaifir/user/{id}/fir

FIR-:

POST - /masaifir/user/fir
